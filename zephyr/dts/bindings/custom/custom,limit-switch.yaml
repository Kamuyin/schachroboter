  Limit switch (end-stop) for homing stepper motors.
  Uses a power/signal output pin and an input pin to detect switch state.
  Switch is typically Normally Open (NO) - when pressed, connects OUT to IN.

compatible: "custom,limit-switch"

properties:
  out-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO pin used to supply signal (VCC) to the switch.
      Should be configured as output, set HIGH.

  in-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO pin used to read the switch state.
      Should be configured as input with appropriate pull resistor.

  active-high:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If present, switch is considered triggered when input reads HIGH.
      For NO switches with pull-down, the switch connects OUT (HIGH) to IN when pressed.
